# Advanced Selectors
## DISTINCT
Make the values unique/do not repeat values if multiple rows contain them.
~~~
SELECT DISTINCT author_lname FROM books;
~~~

## ORDER BY
~~~
SELECT author_lname FROM books ORDER BY author_lname;
~~~

Order is ASCENDING by default.

You can change that:
~~~
SELECT author_lname FROM books ORDER BY author_lname DESC;

SELECT author_lname FROM books ORDER BY author_lname ASC;
~~~

You can provide a number in ORDER BY:
~~~
SELECT author_lname, author_fname FROM books ORDER BY 1 DESC;
~~~

## LIMIT
~~~
SELECT title FROM books ORDER BY release_year ASC LIMIT 3;
~~~

~~~
SELECT title FROM books ORDER BY release_year ASC LIMIT 10,15
--                                                      ^ 15 records starting from index 10
~~~

## LIKE
~~~
SELECT *
FROM books
WHERE LOWER(author_fname) LIKE '%da%'
~~~

~~~
SELECT *
FROM books
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%the_%'
~~~
Matches `ther`, `then` etc.

`_` stands for any character.
