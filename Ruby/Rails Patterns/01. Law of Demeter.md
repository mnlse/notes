One object shouldn't know a lot about another object. It breaks encapsulation.

# Bad Code
~~~erb
<%= @user.job.name %>
<%= @user.job.position %>
~~~

# Good code
Ideally, there should be one level, like:
~~~erb
<%= @user.job_name %>
<%= @user.job_position %>
~~~

Do this using the `delegate` method.
~~~ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :job

  delegate :name, :position,
           prefix: true,
           to: :job
end
~~~

`prefix: true` gives you access to `job_name` and `job_position` methods.

In other words you can access:

`@user.job.name` via `@user.job_name`

and `@user.job.position` via `@user.job_position`

## This is equivalent to
Except shorter:
~~~ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def job_name
    self.job.name
  end

  def job_position
    self.job.position
  end
end
~~~
