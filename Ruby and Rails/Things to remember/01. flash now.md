> 5.2.1 flash.now
> By default, adding values to the flash will make them available to the next request, but sometimes you may want to access those values in the same request. For example, if the create action fails to save a resource and you render the new template directly, that's not going to result in a new request, but you may still want to display a message using the flash. To do this, you can use flash.now in the same way you use the normal flash:

`flash.now[:notice] = "Hello World"`

~~~ruby
flash.now[:error] = "Welcome to the rice fields"
render action: :rice_fields
~~~
^ Same request, will display the flash message.

~~~ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @article = Article.new
  end

  def create
    @article = Article.new(article_params)

    if @article.save(article_params)
      flash[:notice] = "Article has been created"
      redirect_to article_path(@article)
    else
      flash.now[:error] = "There has been an error with saving the article."
      render action: :new
    end
  end

  private

  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :content, :is_published)
  end
end
~~~

~~~ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_article, only: [:edit, :update]
  def index
    ...
  end

  def edit
    ...
  end

  def update
    ...
  end

  def create
    @article = Article.new(article_params)

    if @article.save(article_params)
      flash[:notice] = "Article has been created"
      redirect_to article_path(@article)

      # or redirect_to @article
    else
      flash.now[:error] = "Article has not been created"
      render action: :new
    end
  end

  private
  def set_article
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :content, :is_published)
