# Bad code
~~~ruby
class Billing < ApplicationRecord
  def self.find_not_paid_on_time
    ...
  end

  def self.find_paid_on_time
    ...
  end

  def to_pdf
    ...
  end

  def to_csv
    ...
  end

  def to_xml
    ...
  end

  def to_json
    ...
  end
end
~~~

# Good code

Deletage the converting responsibility to a new class:
~~~ruby
# /app/models/billing.rb
class Billing < ApplicationRecord
  def converter
    BillingConverter.new(self)
  end
end
~~~

~~~ruby
# /app/models/billing_converter.rb
class BillingConverter
  def initialize(billing)
    @billing = billing
  end

  def to_xml
  end

  def to_pdf
  end

  def to_csv
  end

  def to_json
  end
end
~~~

Now you can do:
~~~ruby
@billing.converter.to_pdf
~~~

Which breaks the Law of Demeter, so you use `delegate`:
~~~ruby
delegate :to_xml, :to_json, :to_csv, :to_pdf, to: :converter

def converter
  BillingConverter.new(self)
end
~~~

Now you can do:
~~~ruby
@billing.to_pdf
@billing.to_csv
~~~

# Fat model
[Author: Aaditi Jain on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541823/how-to-use-concerns-in-rails-4)
Consider a Event model. A event has many attenders and comments.

Typically, the event model might look like this

~~~ruby
class Event < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments
  has_many :attenders


  def find_first_comment
    # for the given article/event returns the first comment
  end

  def find_comments_with_word(word)
    # for the given event returns an array of comments which contain the given word
  end

  def self.least_commented
    # finds the event which has the least number of comments
  end

  def self.most_attended
    # returns the event with most number of attendes
  end

  def has_attendee(attendee_id)
    # returns true if the event has the mentioned attendee
  end
end
~~~
# Solution
Models with many associations and otherwise have tendency to accumulate more and more code and become unmanageable. Concerns provide a way to skin-nize fat modules making them more modularized and easy to understand.

The above model can be refactored using concerns as below:
Create a attendable.rb and commentable.rb file in `app/models/concerns/event` folder

attendable.rb
~~~ruby
module Attendable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_many :attenders
  end

  def has_attender(attender_id)
    # returns true if the event has the mentioned attendee
  end

  class_methods do
    def most_attended
      # returns the event with most number of attendes
    end
  end
end
~~~
commentable.rb

~~~ruby
module Commentable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_many :comments
  end

  def find_first_comment
    # for the given article/event returns the first comment
  end

  def find_comments_with_word(word)
    # for the given event returns an array of comments which contain the given word
  end

  class_methods do
    def least_commented
      # finds the event which has the least number of comments
    end
  end
end
~~~
And now using Concerns, your Event model reduces to

# Slim Model
~~~ruby
class Event < ApplicationRecord
  include Commentable
  include Attendable
end
~~~
