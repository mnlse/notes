# Serialize
If you're not on PostgreSQL, which has a JSON attribute,
you can save a Hash or Array in a text field using `serialize`.

This is useful when you have an object that doesn't require a Graphical User Interface to add and remove.

## Model
~~~
rails g model Transaction title:string buyer_address:text
~~~

~~~ruby
class Transaction < ApplicationRecord
  serialize :buyer_address, Hash
end
~~~

## Controller
~~~
class TransactionsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @transaction = Transaction.new
  end

  def create
    @transaction = Transaction.new(permitted_params)

    @transaction.save
  rescue
    render :new
  end

  private
  def permitted_params
    params.require(:transaction).permit(:title, :buyer_address => [:street, :province, :country])
  end
end
~~~

## View
~~~haml
= form_for @transaction do |f|
  = f.label :title
  = f.text_field :title

  = f.fields_for 'transaction[buyer_address]' do |baf|
    %p
      = baf.label :street
      %br
      = baf.text_field :street
    %p
      = baf.label :province
      %br
      = baf.text_field :province
    %p
      = baf.label :country
      %br
      = baf.text_field :country
~~~

# Drawbacks
You cannot use `find`.

# Benchmark
The thing has 2 fields (street, country), which both have the same values: "qwe", "qwe" respectively.

## Method
For serialize:
`Benchmark.measure { Transaction.last.buyer_address }`
For association/relation:
~~~ruby
Transaction has_one BuyerAddress
BuyerAddress belongs_to "some_transaction" with class_name: "Transaction"
~~~
`Benchmark.mesaure { BuyerAddress.last.some_transaction }`

## Serialize
First access:
@real=0.0031496559968218207

Second access:
@real=0.002822665002895519

## Relation
First access:
@real=0.03644988298765384

Second access (cache kicks in):
@real=9.539199527353048e-05,

Which is:
0.00009539199527353048

# Second benchmark
Now let's try inserting 5 paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum into both fields, and see how well the candidates will score.

## Serialize
First access:
@real=0.003880358999595046

Second access:
@real=0.003733273988473229

## Relation
First access:
@real=0.006142640006146394

Second access:
@real=0.0066406890109647065


## Conclusions
The relation is much slower at first access, and much faster at second access.
In other words, the serialized attribute is faster if only accessed once.

The advantage of using serialized attributes is the little amount of space required, little maintainance, closer data binding, faster speed.
