# Use concerns
I have been reading about using model concerns to skin-nize fat models as well as DRY up your model codes. Here is an explanation with examples:

## 1) DRYing up model codes
Consider a Article model, a Event model and a Comment model. An article or an event has many comments. A comment belongs to either Article or Event.

Traditionally, the models may look like this:

Comment Model:
~~~ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
end

class Article < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable

  def find_first_comment
    comments.order("created_at DESC").first
  end

  def self.least_commented
    # return the Article with the least number of comments
  end
end

class Event < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable

  def find_first_comment
    comments.order("created_at DESC").first
  end

  def self.least_commented
    # return the Event with the least number of comments
  end
end
~~~

As we can notice, there is a significant piece of code common to both Event and Article. Using concerns we can extract this common code in a separate module Commentable.

For this create a commentable.rb file in `app/models/concerns`.

~~~ruby
module Commentable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_many :comments, as: :commentable
  end

  # for the given article/event returns the first comment
  def find_first_comment
    comments.first(created_at DESC)
  end

  class_methods do
    def least_commented
      # finds the event which has the least number of comments
    end
  end
end
~~~

And now your models look like this :

~~~ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
end

class Article < ApplicationRecord
  include Commentable
end

class Event < ApplicationRecord
  include Commentable
end
~~~

Concerns can also be used to make models slim, view: '04. Slim models'

# Use metaprogramming
## Bad Code
~~~ruby
class Transaction < ApplicationRecord
  scope :all_in_progress, -> { where(status: "in_progress") }
  scope :all_submitted, -> { where(status: "submitted") }
  scope :all_approved, -> { where(status: "approved") }
  scope :all_shipped, -> { where(status: "shipped") }
  scope :all_received, -> { where(status: "received") }
  scope :all_canceled, -> { where(status: "canceled") }

  def in_progress?
    status == 'in_progress'
  end

  def submitted?
    status == 'submitted'
  end

  def approved?
    status == 'approved'
  end

  def shipped?
    status == 'shipped'
  end

  def received?
    status == 'received'
  end

  def canceled?
    status == 'canceled'
  end
end
~~~

## Good Code (works)
~~~ruby
class Transaction < ApplicationRecord
  STATUSES = %w(in_progress submitted approved shipped received)

  validates :status, presence: true, inclusion: { in: STATUSES }

  STATUSES.each do |status_name|
    scope "all_#{status_name}", -> { where(status: status_name) }

    define_method "#{status_name}?"
      status == status_name
    end
  end
end
~~~

## Even Better Code (EBCâ„¢) (which doesn't work)
Somehow monkey-patch ApplicationRecord, example (doesn't work):

`app/models/extensions/status.rb`
~~~ruby
class ApplicationRecord

  def self.has_statuses(*status_names)
    status_names.each do |status_name|
      scope "all_#{status_name}", -> { where(status: status_name) }

      define_method "#{status_name}?" do
        status == status_name
      end
    end
  end

end
~~~

~~~ruby
require 'extensions/status'

class Transaction < ApplicationRecord
  has_statuses :unsuccessful, :successful, :internal_error
end
~~~

Which doesn't work, because you cannot define scope in that block.
`NoMethodError: undefined method 'scope' for Transaction:Class`

But the `define_method` works, only on an instance. Don't even TRY to add `self` there (it doesn't work)
