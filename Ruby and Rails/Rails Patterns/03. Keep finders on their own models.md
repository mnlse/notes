# Bad code
~~~ruby
class Movie < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :actors

  def main_actors
    actors.where(is_main: true)
  end
end

It's bad code because you're looking up `Actor`s in the `Movie` model.

~~~ruby
class MoviesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @movie = Movie.find(params[:id])
    @main_actors = @movie.main_actors
  end
end
~~~

# Good code
~~~ruby
class Actor
  def main_actors
    where(is_main: true)
  end
end
~~~

~~~ruby
class Movie < ApplicationRecord
  delegate :main_actors,
           to: :actor
end
~~~

The Controller stays the same:
~~~ruby
class MoviesController < ApplicationController
  @movie = Movie.find(params[:id])
  @main_actors = @movie.main_actors
end
~~~
