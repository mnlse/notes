# Real Test

## Theory
What we have written in the last lesson is a **feature test**.
What is a feature test?
A feature test is simply a test of a feature.

Examples:
* listing all `Article`s
* creating an `Article`
* showing an `Article`
* creating a `User`
* clicking a link, logging in, listing all articles

It is basically a **test of a feature**.

## The test
The feature test we will write in this lesson emulates a user,
which goes to the root page and clicks a link.
The link takes the user to a view which lists all articles.

The test creates two articles, which then expects to see on the page.
Once the test is ran, created articles (in the test) are deleted.

With the rules of `TDD`(Test Driven Development), we first write our test, see it fail, then write code to make the application pass the test.
### Feature tests belong
to the `/spec/features` directory.

### Code of the Test
~~~ruby
# spec/features/listing_articles_spec.rb

require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.feature "Listing articles" do
  before do
    # create sample data for use later in the test
    @article1 = Article.create(title: "Article 1", body: "Article 1 test body")
    @article2 = Article.create(title: "I'm a sample article", body: "Hello World")
  end

  scenario "User lists all articles" do
    visit "/"   # visit root page
    click_link "List of articles"

    expect(page).to have_content(@article1.title)
    expect(page).to have_content(@article1.body)

    expect(page).to have_content(@article2.title)
    expect(page).to have_content(@article2.body)
  end
end
~~~
Let's run our test. In TDD we expect our tests to fail, then write the application:
~~~
rspec
~~~

### Writing the application that passes the test
#### Requirements of Application
Our application has to:
* have a root route defined (`visit "/"`) (in `routes.rb`)
* have a link `List of articles` in the root route view (`click_link "List of articles"`)
* have a view that lists all `Article`s.

#### Steps to create Application
1) Generate the Resource `Article` (generating a model and controller):
~~~bash
rails g model Article title:string{60} body:text

rails g controller Articles index
~~~

2) Edit `ArticlesController`:
~~~bash
cd app/controllers/
vim articles_controller.rb
~~~

~~~
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end
end
~~~

3) Create a listing of articles in the view:
~~~bash
cd ../views/articles/
vim index.html.erb
~~~

~~~erb
<h1>Articles index</h1>
<% @articles.each do |article| %>
  <hr/>
  <%= article.title %>
  <%= article.body %>
<% end %>
~~~

4) Create a link to the view that lists all the articles in the view:
~~~bash
cd ../pages/
vim index.html.erb
~~~

~~~erb
<h1>Hello World</h1>
~~~

Change to:

~~~erb
<%= link_to "List of articles", articles_index_path %>
~~~

Run:
~~~
rspec
~~~
Now our test should pass.
