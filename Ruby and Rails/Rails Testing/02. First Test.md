# First Test
Go to `/spec/` folder and create a new spec file called `hello_world_spec.rb`

~~~ruby
# /spec/hello_world_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.feature "Hello World feature" do

  scenario "User visits root page" do
    visit "/"   # visits root_path
    expect(page).to have_content("Hello World")   # expects page to have text "Hello World" (case sensitive)
  end

end
~~~

Now when you run `rspec` in your `Rails.root` directory
~~~
#         feature               scenario
1) Hello World feature User visits root page
	 Failure/Error: visit "/"

	 ActionController::RoutingError:
	 No route matches [GET] "/"

Finished in 0.02029 seconds (files took 5.19 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure
~~~

Let's break down the error message:
1) `Hello World feature` is the feature:

~~~ruby
RSpec.feature "Hello World feature" do
	...
end
~~~

2) `User visits root page` is the scenario:
~~~ruby
RSpec.feature "Hello World feature" do
	scenario "User visits root page"
end
~~~

3) The error:
~~~
 ActionController::RoutingError:
 No route matches [GET] "/"
~~~
The routing error is caused by the fact that **we don't have a root route defined**.

To define a root route:
~~~bash
rails g controller Pages index
cd config/
vim routes.rb

# routes.rb
root to: "pages#index"
~~~

Now write the text "Hello World" in `Pages#index` view:
From `Rails.root` open `app/views/pages/index.html.erb`:
~~~bash
cd app/views/pages/
vim index.html.erb

# index.html.erb
<h1>Hello World</h1>
~~~

Now you can run rspec in `Rails.root`:
~~~bash
rspec
~~~
And it will pass.

Notice `1 example, 0 failures` (emphasis on 0 failures)

## What is Rails.root?
`Rails.root` is the root directory of your application. For example, it's the base folder where your app is.
Example:
~~~
rails new sampleApp -m template.rb
~~~
In this case it's the `sampleApp` directory.

It is important to run `rspec` in your `Rails.root` directory, or else RSpec won't find the `spec` directory.

## Case sensitivity
Try changing
~~~
expect(page).to have_content("Hello World")
~~~
to:
~~~
expect(page).to have_content("hello world")
~~~
Without changing the `Pages#index` view (in our view it's `Hello World`, both capitalized)

And see what error you will get.

## Case insensitivity
You can use **RegExp** in your `have_content` method:
That way you can have case insensitive searches:
~~~
expect(page).to have_content(/hello world/i)
~~~

The `i` flag means case insensitive.
