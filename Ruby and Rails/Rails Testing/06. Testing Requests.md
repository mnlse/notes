`/spec/requests/article_spec.rb`

~~~ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "Articles" do
  before do
    @article = Article.create(title: "Hello World", body: "Lorem Ipsum")
  end

  describe "GET /articles/:id" do

    context 'with existing article' do
      before { get "/articles/#{@article.id}" }

      it "handles existing article" do
        expect(response.status).to eq(200)
      end
    end

    context 'with non-existing article' do
      before { get "/articles/xxxx" }

      it "handles non-existing article" do
        expect(response.status).to eq(302)

        flash_message = "The article you are looking for could not be found"
        expect(flash[:error]).to eq(flash_message)
      end
    end

  end
end
~~~

And in `ApplicationController`:
~~~ruby
class ApplicationController < ActiveRecord::Base
  rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :resource_not_found

  protected
  def resource_not_found
    flash[:error] = "The resource hasn't been found"
    redirect_to root_path, status: :found
  end
end
~~~

Why `status: :found`?
It would make sense to use `status: :not_found`, but it's not a redirect.
404 cannot redirect you from page to page. 302 can.

If you really want 404:
~~~ruby
class ApplicationController < ActiveRecord::Base
  rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :resource_not_found

  protected
  def resource_not_found
    render file: "#{Rails.root}/public/404", status: :not_found
  end
end
